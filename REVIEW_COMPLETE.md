## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before:
```
"FamilyHub Shopping List Manager is the first module 
of the FamilyHub AI-powered family coordination platform."
```
**Problem:** Positioned as a "module" of something bigger, understating current capabilities.

### After:
```
"FamilyHub is an AI-powered family coordination platform 
that helps families manage daily activities through natural 
language interaction. Currently includes two core modules: 
Shopping List Management and Family Schedule Coordination."
```
**Improvement:** Accurately describes current state—a working platform with multiple modules.
